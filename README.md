This is a practice project I made for Webdev

It is a template site consisting of a login, register, home, blog, contact page for a store.

The frontent is done using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JS
The backend has been done using PHP.
Have used MySQL for the database.

Have not hosted this anywhere so to check it out will have to clone the repo and run it on localhost
